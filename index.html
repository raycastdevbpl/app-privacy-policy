    <h1>Privacy Policy for TempContacts</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>

    <p>Thank you for using TempContacts ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Our core principle is privacy: your data is your own, and our app is designed to keep it that way.</p>

    <h2>Information We Access</h2>
    <p>To provide its core functionality, TempContacts requires access to certain information on your device. All of this information is processed <strong>locally on your device only</strong> and is <strong>never uploaded, collected, or shared with us or any third party.</strong></p>
    <p>The permissions we request are:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Read Contacts (`READ_CONTACTS`)</strong>: To display the names of your saved contacts in the call log and to provide contact search functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Contacts (`WRITE_CONTACTS`)</strong>: To save new permanent or temporary contacts to your device's address book when you explicitly choose to do so.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Call Log (`READ_CALL_LOG`)</strong>: To display your call history within the app and to power the callback reminder feature.</li>
        <li><strong>Make Phone Calls (`CALL_PHONE`)</strong>: To initiate a phone call when you tap a call button within the app.</li>
        <li><strong>Read Phone State & Numbers (`READ_PHONE_STATE`, `READ_PHONE_NUMBERS`, `MANAGE_OWN_CALLS`)</strong>: To detect when a call has ended for the optional callback reminder feature and to handle dual-SIM functionality.</li>
        <li><strong>Get Accounts (`GET_ACCOUNTS`)</strong>: To show you a list of available accounts (e.g., Google, SIM) where you can choose to save a permanent contact.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Storage and Security</h2>
    <p>All data accessed by TempContacts, including your contacts, call logs, and any temporary contact or reminder information you create, is stored in a secure, private database <strong>on your device only</strong>. This information is not accessible to other apps and is deleted if you uninstall TempContacts.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>
