    <h1>Privacy Policy for TempContacts</h1>

    <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> August 3, 2025</p>
    <p>Thank you for using TempContacts ("the App"). This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your information. Our core principle is privacy: your data is your own, and our app is designed to keep it that way.

Information We Access

To provide its core functionality, TempContacts requires access to certain information on your device. All of this information is processed locally on your device only and is never uploaded, collected, or shared with us or any third party.

The permissions we request are:

Read Contacts (READ_CONTACTS): To display the names of your saved contacts in the call log and to provide contact search functionality.

Write Contacts (WRITE_CONTACTS): To save new permanent or temporary contacts to your device's address book when you explicitly choose to do so.

Read Call Log (READ_CALL_LOG): To display your call history within the app and to power the callback reminder feature.

Make Phone Calls (CALL_PHONE): To initiate a phone call when you tap a call button within the app.

Read Phone State & Numbers (READ_PHONE_STATE, READ_PHONE_NUMBERS, MANAGE_OWN_CALLS): To detect when a call has ended for the optional callback reminder feature and to handle dual-SIM functionality.

Get Accounts (GET_ACCOUNTS): To show you a list of available accounts (e.g., Google, SIM) where you can choose to save a permanent contact.

Data Storage and Security

All data accessed by TempContacts, including your contacts, call logs, and any temporary contact or reminder information you create, is stored in a secure, private database on your device only. This information is not accessible to other apps and is deleted if you uninstall TempContacts.

Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.
